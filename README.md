# Burgers

-Burgers is an application designed to allow users to add a burger to a mysql database. Then using handlebars, all of the burgers that have been added will render onscreen as well a a button that gives the user the option to eat the burger.

-When a user clicks the button to eat the burger, the burger's eaten status will be updated in the database to true. The user will then be redirected back to the root of the application where both the eaten, and non-eaten burgers will be rendered onscreen.
